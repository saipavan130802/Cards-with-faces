    <p>“My name is Pinapala Sai Pavan, I’m from Guntur, Andhra Pradesh. Currently, I’m pursuing my B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering at KKR & KSR Institute of Technology and Sciences with a CGPA of 8.38.

I have a strong interest in both software development and embedded systems. Over the past few years, I’ve gained skills in Java, C, SQL, HTML, and IoT-related technologies, and I’m comfortable working with tools like Arduino IDE, Matlab, EasyEDA, and Google Cloud.

I worked as a Java Full Stack Trainee at Codegnan IT Solutions, where I focused on automating testing processes and used Python and PowerShell scripts to improve efficiency.

As part of my academic journey, I’ve worked on projects such as an Anti-Theft Vehicle Protection Framework, where I integrated fingerprint authentication, GPS, GSM, and camera modules with ESP32 to provide real-time alerts and intruder detection. I also developed an Automatic Braking System using Arduino and ultrasonic sensors to avoid collisions.

I have completed certifications in Embedded Development, Arduino & Raspberry Pi Applications, and Data Analytics, and I also published a research paper in IJSRET based on my final-year project.

Apart from academics, I’ve led a 4-member team in project development, and I’ve also been recognized with awards like Best Outgoing Student for Special Talent and the Overall Championship Award in Constituency Level Zonal Competitions.

Looking ahead, my goal is to build my career as a software engineer, applying my technical knowledge, leadership skills, and innovative thinking to create impactful solutions.”</p>
